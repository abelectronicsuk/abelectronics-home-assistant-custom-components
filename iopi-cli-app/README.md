# IO Pi Command Line Interface Controller

This program controls the functions of the Microchip MCP23017 I2C based IO controller used on the IO Pi, IO Pi Plus or IO Pi Zero from AB Electronics UK.  If no options are specified iopi will read port 0 from I2C address 0x20.

## iopi command arguments

-a --address=i2c address; e.g., '-a 0x21' sets the I2C address to 0x21; The default address if -a is not specified is 0x20

-p --port=value; set the port to access; e.g., '-p 1' or '--port=1' sets the port to 1.  If no port or pin is specified the program will default to port 0
-n --pin=value; set the pin to access; e.g., '-n 7' or '--pin=7' sets the pin to 7.  If no port or pin is specified the program will default to port 0.  If a port is specified as well as a pin the program will use the selected port and ignore the pin value.

-r --read; Read the status of the selected port or pin; For each pin 0 = logic low, 1 = logic high; If a port has been selected the value can be 0 to 255.  If a pin has been selected the value can be 0 or 1.

-w --write=value; Write a value to the selected port or pin; For each pin 0 = logic low, 1 = logic high; If a port has been selected the value can be 0 to 255.  If a pin has been selected the value can be 0 or 1;  e.g., '-w 1 -n 3' will set pin 3 to be logic high.

-d --direction=value; set port or pin direction; For each pin 0 = output, 1 = input; If a port has been selected the value can be 0 to 255.  If a pin has been selected the value can be 0 or 1;  e.g., '-d 1 -n 3' will set pin 3 to be an input.  

-i --invert=value; invert the selected port or pin; For each pin 0 = normal, 1 = inverted; If a port has been selected the value can be 0 to 255.  If a pin has been selected the value can be 0 or 1;  e.g., '-i 1 -n 3' will set pin 3 to be inverted.

-u --pullup=value; Set the internal 100K pull-up resistors for the selected port or pin; 1 = enabled, 0 = disabled; If a port has been selected the value can be 0 to 255.  If a pin has been selected the value can be 0 or 1;  e.g., '-u 1 -n 3' will enable the pull-up resistor for pin 3.

-m --mirrorinterrupts=value; Set the interrupt pins to be mirrored or for separate ports; 1 = The pins are internally connected, 0 = The pins are not connected. INTA is associated with PortA and INTB is associated with PortB;  e.g., '-m 1' will set both interrupt pins IA and IB to be mirrored.

-l --interruptpolarity=value; Set the polarity of the interrupt output pins IA and IB; 1 = Active-high, 0 = Active-low; ; e.g., '-l 1' will set the interrupt output pins to go logic high when an interrupt occurs.

-t --interrupttype=value; Sets the type of interrupt for the selected pin or port; 1 = interrupt is fired when the pin matches the default value, 0 = the interrupt is fired on state change; If a port has been selected the value can be 0 to 255.  If a pin has been selected the value can be 0 or 1; e.g., '-t 0 -n 3' will set the interrupt for pin 3 to trigger on state change.

-f --interruptdefaults=value; Set the compare value for interrupt-on-change on the selected port. If the associated pin level is the opposite from the set value an interrupt occurs; If a port has been selected the value can be 0 to 255.  If a pin has been selected the value can be 0 or 1;  e.g., '-f 1 -n 3' will set the default value for pin 3 to be logic high.

-e --enableinterrupts=value; Enable interrupts for the selected port or pin; For each pin 0 = off, 1 = on; If a port has been selected the value can be 0 to 255.  If a pin has been selected the value can be 0 or 1;  e.g., '-e 1 -n 3' will enable the interrupt for pin 3.

-s --interruptstatus; Read the interrupt status for the selected port or pin

-c --interruptcapture; Read the value from the selected port or pin at the time of the last interrupt trigger

-z --resetinterrupts; Set the interrupts IA and IB to 0

-h --help; Display a list of available options

-b --binary; Set the output number format to binary; e.g., 0b00100100

-x --hex; Set the output number format to hexidecimal; e.g., 0xFC
