[![Community Forum][forum-shield]](https://www.abelectronics.co.uk/forums/)

This custom component is designed to run the [ADC Differential Pi](https://www.abelectronics.co.uk/p/65/adc-differential-pi-raspberry-pi-analogue-to-digital-converter) Raspberry Pi expansion boards from AB Electronics UK
 with Home Assistant smart home software from https://www.home-assistant.io/ on a Raspberry Pi computer.

The ADC Differential Pi is an 8 channel 18 bit analogue to digital converter designed to work with the Raspberry Pi. The ADC Differential Pi is based on two Microchip MCP3424 A/D converters each containing 4 analogue inputs. This library uses our own ADC Differential Pi Python library from https://www.abelectronics.co.uk/kb/article/23/python-library-and-demos


This component will add a `sensor` with eight input voltages returned as attributes.

## Requirements

This component requires the I2C bus on the Raspberry Pi to be enabled.

If you are using the Home Assistant Operating System you canâ€™t use existing methods to enable the I2C bus on a Raspberry Pi, you will have to enable the I2C interface manually. Please follow the instruction on https://www.home-assistant.io/common-tasks/os#enable-i2c to enable I2C on your Home Assistant Operating System installation.

## Installation

1. Using your tool of choice, open the directory (folder) for your HA configuration (where you find `configuration.yaml`).
2. If you do not have a `custom_components` directory (folder) there, you need to create it.
3. In the `custom_components` directory (folder) create a new folder called `abelectronicsadcdifferentialpi`.
4. Download _all_ the files from the `custom_components/abelectronicsadcdifferentialpi/` directory (folder) in this repository.
5. Place the files you downloaded in the new directory (folder) you created.
6. Restart Home Assistant

Using your HA configuration directory (folder) as a starting point you should now also have this:

```text
custom_components/abelectronicsadcdifferentialpi/__init__.py
custom_components/abelectronicsadcdifferentialpi/sensor.py
custom_components/abelectronicsadcdifferentialpi/ADCDifferentialPi.py
custom_components/abelectronicsadcdifferentialpi/manifest.json
```
## Example configuration.yaml

```yaml
sensor:
  - platform: abelectronicsadcdifferentialpi
    name: ADCDifferentialPi
    i2c_address: 0x68
    i2c_address2: 0x69
    pga: 1
    bitrate: 18
    scan_interval: 5
   
```
# Usage

## Sensor Configuration Variables

The sensor component uses the following variables to configure the ADC sensor

Key | Type | Required | Description
-- | -- | -- | --
`i2c_address` | `Hex` | `True` | This contains the I2C address of the ADC Differential Pi device. The default I2C addresses on the ADC Differential Pi are 0x68 and 0x69. This address selects inputs 1 to 4.
`i2c_address2` | `Hex` | `True` | This contains the I2C address of the ADC Differential Pi device. The default I2C addresses on the ADC Differential Pi are 0x68 and 0x69. This address selects inputs 5 to 8.
`pga` | `Integer` | `True` | Set the gain of the PGA on the chip. 1, 2, 4 or 8.
`bitrate` | `Integer` | `True` | This contains the selected bitrate for samples, this can be 12, 14, 16 or 18. Sample speeds for selected bit rate: 12 = 12 bit (240SPS max) 14 = 14 bit (60SPS max) 16 = 16 bit (15SPS max) 18 = 18 bit (3.75SPS max).
`scan_interval` | `Integer` | `True` | This contains the scan interval in seconds between reading the device in seconds.


## Editing the configuration.yaml file to add the binary sensor 

1. Using the text editor of choice open the `configuration.yaml` for your HA configuration.
2. Add a new `sensor` with the following code: 
   ```yaml
    sensor:
      - platform: abelectronicsadcdifferentialpi
    ```
3.  Add the following attributes to setup the component:
    ```yaml
    name: ADCDifferentialPi
    i2c_address: 0x68
    i2c_address2: 0x69
    pga: 1
    bitrate: 18
    scan_interval: 5
    ```
3.  Add the template sensor for the component to access the attributes:
    ```yaml  
    - platform: template
      sensors:
        adcdiffinput1:
          value_template: "{{states.sensor.adcdifferentialpi.attributes.input1}}"
          friendly_name: "ADC Differential Pi input 1"
          unit_of_measurement: "Volts"
        adcdiffinput2:
          value_template: "{{states.sensor.adcdifferentialpi.attributes.input2}}"
          friendly_name: "ADC Differential Pi input 2"
          unit_of_measurement: "Volts"
        adcdiffinput3:
          value_template: "{{states.sensor.adcdifferentialpi.attributes.input3}}"
          friendly_name: "ADC Differential Pi input 3"
          unit_of_measurement: "Volts"
        adcdiffinput4:
          value_template: "{{states.sensor.adcdifferentialpi.attributes.input4}}"
          friendly_name: "ADC Differential Pi input 4"
          unit_of_measurement: "Volts"
        adcdiffinput5:
          value_template: "{{states.sensor.adcdifferentialpi.attributes.input5}}"
          friendly_name: "ADC Differential Pi input 5"
          unit_of_measurement: "Volts"
        adcdiffinput6:
          value_template: "{{states.sensor.adcdifferentialpi.attributes.input6}}"
          friendly_name: "ADC Differential Pi input 6"
          unit_of_measurement: "Volts"
        adcdiffinput7:
          value_template: "{{states.sensor.adcdifferentialpi.attributes.input7}}"
          friendly_name: "ADC Differential Pi input 7"
          unit_of_measurement: "Volts"
        adcdiffinput8:
          value_template: "{{states.sensor.adcdifferentialpi.attributes.input8}}"
          friendly_name: "ADC Differential Pi input 8"
          unit_of_measurement: "Volts"
    
    ```

The completed YMAL code should look like this:
```yaml
sensor:
  - platform: abelectronicsadcdifferentialpi
    name: ADCDifferentialPi
    i2c_address: 0x68
    i2c_address2: 0x69
    pga: 1
    bitrate: 18
    scan_interval: 5

  - platform: template
    sensors:
      adcdiffinput1:
        value_template: "{{states.sensor.adcdifferentialpi.attributes.input1}}"
        friendly_name: "ADC Differential Pi input 1"
        unit_of_measurement: "Volts"
      adcdiffinput2:
        value_template: "{{states.sensor.adcdifferentialpi.attributes.input2}}"
        friendly_name: "ADC Differential Pi input 2"
        unit_of_measurement: "Volts"
      adcdiffinput3:
        value_template: "{{states.sensor.adcdifferentialpi.attributes.input3}}"
        friendly_name: "ADC Differential Pi input 3"
        unit_of_measurement: "Volts"
      adcdiffinput4:
        value_template: "{{states.sensor.adcdifferentialpi.attributes.input4}}"
        friendly_name: "ADC input 4"
        unit_of_measurement: "Volts"
      adcdiffinput5:
        value_template: "{{states.sensor.adcdifferentialpi.attributes.input5}}"
        friendly_name: "ADC Differential Pi input 5"
        unit_of_measurement: "Volts"
      adcdiffinput6:
        value_template: "{{states.sensor.adcdifferentialpi.attributes.input6}}"
        friendly_name: "ADC Differential Pi input 6"
        unit_of_measurement: "Volts"
      adcdiffinput7:
        value_template: "{{states.sensor.adcdifferentialpi.attributes.input7}}"
        friendly_name: "ADC Differential Pi input 7"
        unit_of_measurement: "Volts"
      adcdiffinput8:
        value_template: "{{states.sensor.adcdifferentialpi.attributes.input8}}"
        friendly_name: "ADC Differential Pi input 8"
        unit_of_measurement: "Volts"

```

You can now add the sensor into the user interface.
